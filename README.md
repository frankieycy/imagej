## Brownian Motion

* PHYS3710 Experimental Project: Analysis
* Last: 3/10/2019

## Goals

* analysis of distributions of particles over time
* estimate Avogadro's constant

## Inputs

* particle tracks in .csv format

## Outputs

* snapshots of displacement distributions
* a plot of squared displacement (diffusion spread) against time
* collected in `img/`
* a .csv file containing squared displacement against time

## Result

* the solution to the diffusion equation **experimentally** recovered!
